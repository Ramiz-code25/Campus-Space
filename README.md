# Campus-Space
A real-time occupancy tracking app

# Purpose
The purpose of the Campus Space app is to enhance the overall campus experience by helping students and staff efficiently utilize common sitting and study areas within the university. The app is designed to provide real-time information about the availability, crowd density, and ambience of various campus spaces, enabling users to choose suitable locations based on their preferences and needs.
By offering accurate and up-to-date data, Campus Space aims to reduce the time spent searching for appropriate study or discussion areas and improve the productivity and comfort of campus life. Whether a student is looking for a quiet environment to focus on assignments or a lively place to collaborate with peers, the app guides them to the right spot at the right time.
Additionally, Campus Space promotes better management of campus resources by balancing the use of different areas, preventing overcrowding, and encouraging the use of underutilized spaces. It also supports community engagement by allowing students to interact, share information, and coordinate activities through the platform.
In summary, the purpose of Campus Space is to:
Save time and effort for students and staff.
Improve study and collaboration experiences.
Promote effective utilization of university spaces.
Enhance communication and community interaction across the campus.

# Problem statement
Students and staff often waste valuable time searching for appropriate places to study, relax, or interact on campus. Common areas, such as libraries, cafeterias, lounges, and study halls, often become overcrowded during peak hours, while other areas remain underutilized. There is no efficient system to help users decide where to go based on their needs â€” whether they want a quiet environment to focus or a lively space to collaborate.
This lack of information leads to:
-Time wasted in walking around searching for seats.
-Reduced productivity due to noisy or crowded environments.
-Uneven utilization of campus spaces.
-Difficulty for new students to locate suitable areas.
-Campus Space addresses these challenges by providing data-driven, real-time insights into campus area usage.

# Goals
The goal of Campus Space is to optimize the utilization of university common areas by helping students and staff quickly find suitable spots for studying, discussing, relaxing, or engaging in social interaction. The app aims to save time, enhance productivity, and foster better collaboration by providing real-time information about crowd density, noise levels, and available spaces across the campus.
